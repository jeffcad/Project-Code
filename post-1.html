                        salary of US$563,500 and months of holiday. Did you know that every MLB team offers 
                        regular fans like you the chance for a walk-on try-out during any game? All you have
                        to do is run out onto the field during a game and run the bases as fast as you can. 
                        If your time is good enough, you can get a spot on the team! They'll take you to the 
                        back of the stadium, where you can negotiate the length of your <s>prison term</s> 
                        contract!</p>

                        He decided to start his own business, and now makes a living by <s>suckering
