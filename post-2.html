                        win the jackpot! So drain your bank account, buy my program, and use the 
                        rest of the money on lottery tickets!  Don't delay, win the lottery today!</p>

                    <p>Jeff used to work a regular job, 
                        until he got laid off because of Covid-19. He decided to start his own

                        teaching others how they too can overcome a Covid-19 job loss. He does not 
                        give refunds.</p>

                        does not disclose the location or reveal his last name, due to the reasons 
                        above.</p>
